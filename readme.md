# editor-lite

A minimal, fast code editor focused on speed and simplicity. editor-lite provides a small, responsive editing experience with the core features you need without the overhead of a full-featured IDE.

## What it does
- Lightweight code editing with basic features (open/save, search).
- Syntax highlighting for common languages.
- Fast startup and low memory usage compared to heavier editors.

## Why I made it
VS Code is powerful but can feel slow and heavy on some machines. editor-lite was created to offer a snappy, low-overhead alternative for quick edits and focused work.

## Requirements
- Node.js 16 or newer
- npm, yarn, or pnpm (any modern package manager will work)

## How to run (development)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KareemSab278/editor-lite.git
   cd editor-lite
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   clear; npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   clear; npm run tauri dev
   ```
